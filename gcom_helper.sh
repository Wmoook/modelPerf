# GCoM Automation Script
#
# This script automates cloning and building the GCoM project.
# Usage: ./gcom_helper.sh [git|build]
#   git   - Clone the GCoM repository into the current directory (creates a 'gcom' folder).
#   build - Build gzstream, Boost Serialization, and compile the GCoM project.
#
#
# If running in a batch job or non-interactive shell, use a login shell for modules:
# e.g., change the shebang to #!/bin/bash -l to ensure 'module' commands work.
